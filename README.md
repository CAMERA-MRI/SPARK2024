# Sprint AI Training for African Medical Imaging Knowledge Translation (SPARK) Academy
## SPARK Github

This Github repository serves as the access point to the SPARK Academy MICCAI BraTS challenge models from groups participating in the 2024 SPARK Academy. 

For more information about SPARK, the academy's objectives visit [SPARK's event website](https://event.fourwaves.com/spark). All training events are accessible to registered participants through SPARK's event website.

## About SPARK:

The Sprint AI Training for African Medical Imaging Knowledge Translation (SPARK) program is designed to train a new generation of African artificial intelligence (AI) experts in medical imaging who can train others. We use a case-based learning approach and collective intelligence from various related fields (radiology, medical physics, computer science, neurology/neurosurgery, and oncology) to rapidly turn AI knowledge into action.

Each SPARK Academy is aimed at a real-world use case and implements collective intelligence built around a networking space to advance AI capacity and rapid implementation in Africa. SPARK Academy is endorsed by The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Society and over the past two years have trained over 350 African clinicians, scientists, and students from 23 African Countries and guided them in developing state-of-art AI methods for glioma brain tumor segmentation. The is expanding and includes participarnts from 3 Southeast Asian countries.
